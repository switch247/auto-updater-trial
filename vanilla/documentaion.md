**Updater Documentation**

**Overview**

The Updater is a Python script that checks for updates to an application and downloads and installs the latest version if available. It uses a simple API to communicate with the server and retrieve the latest version information.

**Features**

* Checks for updates to the application
* Downloads and installs the latest version if available
* Creates a shortcut to the application on the desktop
* Displays a progress bar during the update process
* Handles errors and exceptions during the update process

**Usage**

1. Run the Updater script to start the update process.
2. The Updater will check for updates to the application and display a progress bar during the process.
3. If an update is available, the Updater will download and install the latest version.
4. Once the update is complete, the Updater will create a shortcut to the application on the desktop.

**API**

The Updater uses a simple API to communicate with the server and retrieve the latest version information. The API consists of two endpoints:

* `/checklatest`: Returns the latest version of the application.
* `/update`: Downloads the latest version of the application.

**Error Handling**

The Updater handles errors and exceptions during the update process. If an error occurs, the Updater will display an error message to the user and continue running.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* `requests` library
* `tkinter` library
* `ttkbootstrap` library
* `winshell` library

**Installation**

1. Install the required libraries using pip: `pip install requests tkinter ttkbootstrap winshell`
2. Run the Updater script to start the update process.

**Configuration**

The Updater can be configured to use a different API endpoint or to download the update from a different location. To configure the Updater, modify the `base_url` variable in the `Updater` class.

**Security**

The Updater uses a simple API to communicate with the server and retrieve the latest version information. However, this API is not secure and should not be used in production environments. To secure the API, use a secure protocol such as HTTPS and implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Troubleshooting**

If the Updater encounters an error during the update process, it will display an error message to the user. To troubleshoot the issue, check the error message and modify the Updater configuration as needed.

**Changelog**

* Version 1.0: Initial release of the Updater script.
* Version 1.1: Added support for creating a shortcut to the application on the desktop.
* Version 1.2: Improved error handling and added support for secure API endpoints.
